# Welcome to Lumache's documentation!!!

**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

:::{admonition} You can use both MyST and reStructuredText
:class: tip

Activating the MyST parser will simply *enable* parsing markdown files with MyST, and the rST parser that ships with Sphinx will still work the same way.
Files ending with `.md` will be parsed as MyST, and files ending in `.rst` will be parsed as reStructuredText.

   This project is under active development.
